# Scream Deck v1

## What is it?

It's a simple program to control OBS (OpenBroadcastSoftware) and Audacity with an Infrared Remote using Python and an Arduino.

It's far from perfect and has some Issues, but its usable and was a random idea I had for a Youtube video.

## Issues

- RGB-LED is like 80% right (should be 100%)
- error-handling is suboptimal

#### Developed on Linux

Meaning that if you are on Windows you don't need the "port.sh"-file (that's why it's in a folder named "Linux" duh)
